<p>
This package provides an example of using the Cloth modeling capabilities to create unique topologies. These examples model blankets folded according to rules of origami, the Japanese art of folding paper. The models are parameterized according to three origami parameters, M, H, and R, which control the number and positions of the folds and overall dimensions. Two specific topologies are modeled: one with M = 3 and one with M = 6. In both topologies, H and R are set to 2.
